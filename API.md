There are total of 25 pages of statistics like this. So the `/player` only return the first page.

- There is one of the endpoint is `/player:id`, you can try this as `localhost:3030/player237`. This will return the player in id 237 statistics.

```

{"id":237,"first_name":"LeBron","height_feet":6,"height_inches":8,"last_name":"James","position":"F","team":{"id":14,"abbreviation":"LAL","city":"Los Angeles","conference":"West","division":"Pacific","full_name":"Los Angeles Lakers","name":"Lakers"},"weight_pounds":250}
```

- There is one endpoint is based on enter the player's name. the endpoint is `/player/name`. The name is the player name that you want to enter. For example: `localhost:3030/player/Anthony Davis` will return the following statistics.
  `{"data":[{"id":117,"first_name":"Anthony","height_feet":6,"height_inches":10,"last_name":"Davis","position":"F-C","team":{"id":14,"abbreviation":"LAL","city":"Los Angeles","conference":"West","division":"Pacific","full_name":"Los Angeles Lakers","name":"Lakers"},"weight_pounds":253}],"meta":{"total_pages":1,"current_page":1,"next_page":null,"per_page":25,"total_count":1}}`

## There are also some expect input value for POST method for the public APIs.

But I received the user input value in the server port `localhost:3000`, and I performed these data based on the user input for the player ID or player name. You might want to try this by going to the [application page](http://localhost:3000/).
